### Abstract
RA-SWAPI has been designed from scratch as a SPA based on the following stack:
* **webpack** as module bundler 
* **yarn** as dependency manager
* **React** as a JS library builder for user-interface
* **jest** as a JS test framework
* **enzyme** as a JS testing utility
* **git** as version control system
* **SWAPI** as consuming API for StarWars data [ (SWAPI) ](https://swapi.dev/)

### About React implementation
Components have been implemented using both React approaches:
* **class components** have been defined as stateful components, using lifecycle methods to control own render
* **functional components** have been defined as stateful components taking advantadge of useState and useEffect hooks.

### About styles
BEM (Block__Element--Modifier) has been used as CSS implementation pattern. No framework or library has been used, but CSSModules and corresponding loaders in order to avoid rules collision. 

### About testing
Jest and Enzyme have been used with testing purpose in both sides:
* unit test for business logic
* component test for React components
